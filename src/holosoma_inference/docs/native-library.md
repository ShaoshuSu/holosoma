# Native inference library

The C++ library owns model execution, observation history, action scaling and
policy state. Python binds that same implementation. Constructing a library
policy opens no robot, socket, keyboard listener or SDK interface.

## Python

The shared front door is `Policy(preset_path, checkpoint_path)`. Its `step(RobotState)` returns a `JointCommand` for locomotion, embedded-motion WBT or host-reference WBT. `set_reference(ReferenceWindow)` supplies the latter's reference. The preset/config factories below compose this same class.

Build the extension with a C++17 compiler and CMake:

```sh
uv pip install ./src/holosoma_inference
```

Dependencies are resolved by CMake from installed packages or pinned downloads.
Set `ONNXRUNTIME_ROOT` for an existing SDK, including a CUDA-enabled SDK. The
default source build uses CPU inference. Robot SDKs are optional extras for the
explicit command-line runner, not dependencies of the device-free API.

```python
from dataclasses import replace
import numpy as np
import holosoma_inference as inference

config = inference.get_config("g1-29dof-loco")
config = replace(config, task=replace(config.task, model_path="policy.onnx"))
policy = inference.get_policy_from_preset(config)
policy.reset()

# One already-packed actor observation, in the model's configured term order.
obs_config = config.observation
width = sum(obs_config.obs_dims[t] for t in obs_config.obs_dict["actor_obs"])
width *= obs_config.history_length_dict.get("actor_obs", 1)
targets = policy.step(np.zeros((1, width), dtype=np.float32))
```

`get_config` returns an independent copy and includes registered extension
presets. SDK-specific fields on robot-config subclasses remain available to the
Python transport owner; the native engine receives the common robot contract.
`InferenceConfig` and `LocomotionPolicy(config)` are also exported for
composition without a named preset. Model paths may be local or supported W&B
URLs, resolved before native construction. Packed observations must have shape
`(N,)` or `(1, N)` and contain finite values. The returned `(1, num_joints)` array
contains absolute joint-position targets, including defaults and calibration
offsets, not raw neural-network actions.

For native observation construction, `policy.step_state(state)` accepts the
existing joint-ordered flat state:
`[base_pos(3), quaternion_wxyz(4), joint_pos(N), base_lin_vel(3),
base_ang_vel(3), joint_vel(N)]`, optionally followed by corrected gravity (3).
It returns a command with `q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp` and `kd`. Start with
`autostart=False` for explicit `policy.command("START")` / `"STOP"` / `"INIT"`
control. `velocity(x, y, yaw)` supplies a locomotion request.
`step_state` advances the gait phase once per call; an external loop that already
advances it passes `advance_phase=False`. `infer_offsets(state)` warms the native
model and history without changing engagement or publishing a command.

## Live-reference whole-body tracking

Embedded-motion policies read their reference outputs from the model. A
live-reference policy instead receives reference frames from its caller and
derives its observation layout from ONNX `experiment_config` metadata. These
contracts remain explicit; neither guesses the other's layout from its width.

SONIC-aligned layout names refer to NVIDIA's public
[GEAR-SONIC model family](https://github.com/NVlabs/GR00T-WholeBodyControl).
The parser retains the corresponding exporter metadata keys for compatibility.

```python
from holosoma_inference import Policy, RobotState, ReferenceWindow

policy = Policy.from_live_model("live-policy.onnx")
state = RobotState()
state.dof_pos = state.dof_vel = [0.0] * policy.num_dofs()
reference = ReferenceWindow()
slots = max(1, len(policy.lookahead_offsets))
# Replace these illustrative values with caller-buffered frames at the trained offsets.
reference.q = reference.dq = [0.0] * (slots * policy.num_dofs())
reference.quat = [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]] * slots
policy.set_reference(reference)
policy.set_elapsed_seconds(0.0)
command = policy.step(state)
```

The snippet illustrates the types, not a robot motion sequence. Live frames use
canonical G1 joint order, wxyz orientation, body-local angular velocity and SI
units. `reset_heading()` reanchors heading and motion phase while preserving
history; `reset()` starts a new episode and clears history/action feedback.
With no explicit elapsed clock, the live API advances one model timestep per call. Update `set_elapsed_seconds(seconds)` before each tick to preserve motion phase across dropped ticks; pass `None` to return to tick counting. `set_control_interval(seconds)` sets the elapsed-clock conversion. Python retains only the currently supplied reference and returns independent command snapshots. `set_reference(None)` clears it. The former `LiveWbtPolicy` entry point remains available for compatibility.

The reference is offset-major, with one quaternion per frame. Window dimensions must match the checkpoint; malformed or non-finite input is rejected before inference. The first future sample is also the current reference unless `ReferenceWindow.current` explicitly supplies a `PolicyReferenceFrame`. The default 0p2s preset uses five offsets, but metadata-complete checkpoints may declare other layouts.

## C++

```sh
cmake -S src/holosoma_inference/holosoma_cpp -B build/native \
  -DHOLOSOMA_BUILD_RUNNER=OFF -DHOLOSOMA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
cmake --build build/native -j
cmake --install build/native --prefix "$HOME/.local"
```

Consumers use `find_package(holosomaInference CONFIG REQUIRED)` and link `holosoma::inference`. No robot SDK or YAML header is needed by consumers:

```cpp
#include <holosoma_cpp/api.hpp>

holosoma::Policy policy("preset.yaml", "checkpoint.onnx");
holosoma::RobotState state;  // fill joint positions, velocities and base orientation
const holosoma::JointCommand& command = policy.step(state);
```

Relative model paths inside a preset resolve against its directory. An explicit checkpoint argument resolves against the caller's working directory. For metadata-complete live models, construct `Policy(live_policy_config(path, use_gpu, threads))`; supply a borrowed `ReferenceWindow` before stepping and keep it alive until replaced. `num_dofs()`, `dof_names()`, `config()` and the `policy()` escape hatch follow the same API for all three policy families. `OfflineInterface` is also exported for shadow-mode integrations.

`GeneralWBTPolicy` adapts the metadata-driven core rather than maintaining another observation implementation. It shares the policy slot's ONNX session, including CUDA/thread options. `InferenceEngine` is a compatibility alias. Configuration factories, packed observations and explicit engagement remain available as composition extensions. Each instance has one owner; serialize calls, including reference mutation. The high-level Python preset facade provides a lock; direct `Policy` bindings release the GIL during inference and require caller serialization.

## Command-line compatibility

The Python `python -m holosoma_inference.run_policy` entry point retains Tyro
arguments, presets, secondary policies, W&B resolution, SDK plugins and input
providers. Built-in policies use the native engine. The Python transport layer
supports explicit `interface`, `velocity_input`, `command_provider` and
`shared_hardware` injection instead of constructing hardware and then patching
it out. SDK command overrides remain in joint order; the SDK owns motor
permutation. A configured simulation clock continues to use the Python clock
subscriber, while the C++ engine owns timestep conversion.

Robot-specific adapters can override `transform_command(command, state)` to
adjust final joint-order targets or gains, for example a smooth startup hold,
without reimplementing inference. Invalid shapes, non-finite values and negative
gains are rejected before transmission. Embedded-motion policies expose
`initial_motion` for such initialization, and adapters receive a model-switch
hook after the native model changes.

For editable development, reinstall after changing C++ source. Container
dependency stages compile that source before the final Python-source overlay,
so a Python-only edit can reuse the native build and a C++ edit invalidates it.

The former Python policy implementations are retained only under
`holosoma_cpp/tests/python_reference` as independent replay oracles. They are
excluded from the installed package. Custom policies should compose the native
library and keep transport-specific logic outside the inference engine.

## Verification

```sh
uv pip install './src/holosoma_inference[dev]'
cmake -S src/holosoma_inference/holosoma_cpp -B build/native-tests \
  -DHOLOSOMA_WITH_UNITREE_SDK=OFF -DHOLOSOMA_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DPython_EXECUTABLE="$(command -v python)"
cmake --build build/native-tests -j
ctest --test-dir build/native-tests --output-on-failure
python -m pytest --import-mode=importlib src/holosoma_inference/tests -q
```

Tests cover both model contracts, observation history, heading/FK, lookahead,
clocks, reload failure, native Python loading and SDK-boundary joint ordering.
Synthetic models and recorded golden vectors do not establish physical robot
stability; evaluate the selected checkpoint on the intended robot separately.
